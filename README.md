## Learning Objectives

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of `main`
- How does the shell use the `PATH` to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the `execve` system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is `EOF` / “end-of-file”?

- `waitpid` (man 2 waitpid)
- `wait3` (man 2 wait3)
- `wait4` (man 2 wait4)
- `write` (man 2 write)

## Tasks

0. Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

1. Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
	- Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:
	- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
	- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
	- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
	- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
	- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
	- Handle errors.
	- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

You don’t have to:
	- use the PATH
	- implement built-ins
	- handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
	- be able to move the cursor
	- handle commands with arguments
execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…

2. Simple shell 0.1 +
	- Handle command lines with arguments

3. Simple shell 0.2 +
	- Handle the PATH
	- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

4. Simple shell 0.3 +
	- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
	- Usage: exit
	- You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

5. Simple shell 0.4 +
	- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
